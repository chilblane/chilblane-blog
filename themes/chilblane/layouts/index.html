          <h2>Hi there!</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a product designer and design technologist with extensive
            experience in marketing websites and conversion forms. I also focus
            on design systems and branding, information architecture, and visual
            design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Development-wise, I have some experience with React,
            Sass, Javascript build tools like Webpack and Grunt,
            and static generators like Hugo and Jekyll. I do not
            consider myself a programmer or software engineer,
            but aim to ensure good design translates into good
            code and a good user experience for the end user.

          <p>
            The intersection of gaming and social media is an area I'm
            well-versed in, and the streaming/influencer industry is an area I'd
            like to explore in my career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applicant tracking software and recruitment marketing is an area
            that fascinates me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also interested in the product and UX approaches in minimizing
            abuse and harassment on social platforms.
