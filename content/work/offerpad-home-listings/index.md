I joined Offerpad shortly before they launched the first version of their home listings. As a design exercise, while we were exploring redesigning other parts of Offerpad's website, I imagined what an improved UI for our home listings could look like. This would serve as a foundation for later design work.

At the beginning of 2019, I began work on the buy 2.0 project with our web development team and our product manager.

Here's early low-fidelity (no color) mockups of the search results page. High fidelity mockups can be found in this [Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/B0v7djr0x1os8kxJjSTSvk/Daniel-s-buy-mocks).

At this point, I ended design work for the results page and worked with the web team to build it. Afterwards, design responsibilities for the Buy website were handed off to our other designer.
